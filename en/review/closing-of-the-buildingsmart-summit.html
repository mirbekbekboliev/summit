Room Leaders reported to the Closing Plenary about the current projects and developments, among them IFC for Rail and the Professional Certification Programme that are already extremely well developped.&amp;nbsp; Participants came from more than 30 countries to Dusseldorf where they found excellent working conditions and possibilities to make partially substantial progress in developing open standards for the digitisation of planning, construction and operation of buildings.</div><div class="text-with-media__full-text"><br />
A thoroughly positive conclusion was drawn by both the responsible persons and the participants of the buildingSMART International Standards Summit, which took place from 25 to 28 March 2019 in Düsseldorf. In more than 50 working groups, experts from more than 30 countries worked on open standards for the digital design, construction and operation of buildings. One focus of this buildingSMART Summit was the work on open standards for railway infrastructure projects. In addition, important impulses for strategically important projects were set. These included the integration of geoinformation systems in BIM, as well as the basics for the Digital Gemini and Common Data Environments.<br />
<br />
More than 1000 participants from more than 30 countries attended the buildingSMART International Standards Summit in Düsseldorf from March 25 to 28, 2019, which was the largest summit in the more than 20 year history of buildingSMART. This made the Summit, which was followed by the 17th buildingSMART User Day with a further 500 participants, the largest conference on the digitisation of the construction and real estate industry in Germany.<br />
<br />
The heart of the buildingSMART International Standards Summit is the work on open and manufacturer-neutral standards for digital planning, construction and operation - experts, users and users from all areas of the construction and real estate industry and the software industry worldwide participate in these through buildingSMART. This work is organized in so-called "Rooms", of which there are two main categories: the Technical Focus Rooms and the User Focus Rooms. These rooms, in turn, are subdivided thematically. For example, there is a separate room for the railway infrastructure sector, which is divided into various topic-related working groups. In these rooms, experts from all over the world work together on a voluntary basis to develop open standards and interfaces for digital planning, construction and operation and to establish them worldwide. Typically, the work is done through video and telephone conferencing, cloud applications, and other digital tools.&nbsp;Twice a year, the community meets at the buildingSMART Standards Summit.&nbsp;Richard Petrie, CEO of buildingSMART International, sums up this approach as follows: "Only if we regularly exchange our experiences with digital work and planning methods in practice will we achieve faster, cheaper and better results. I am therefore pleased that more and more users around the world are working and discussing with buildingSMART".<br />
<br />
More than 1000 participants came together in Düsseldorf to work together on the buildingSMART standards on four intensive days and to use the opportunities of the personal meeting to exchange ideas and discuss the current development of BIM and other digital methods and techniques for digital design, construction and operation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Federal government expects open standards for digitisation</strong><br />
<br />
At the end of the Summit, Lothar Fehn Krestas, Head of the Construction Division at the Federal Ministry of the Interior for Construction and Home Affairs, stressed the importance the German government attaches to open standards for digital design, construction and operation. He described buildingSMART as a "strong partner at our side". The federal government is actively working on several strands to increase the use of digital methods and techniques for federal buildings.<br />
<br />
On the closing day of the buildingSMART Summit, the heads of the various rooms presented the results of their work and gave an outlook on further developments. The work in the area of IFC for Rail, which was driven forward with a high level of commitment and dedication, was regarded as particularly outstanding. The work on the Professional Certification Program of buildingSMART, the standard for continuing vocational education and training in BIM, was also regarded as particularly successful. In Germany, the first module of this globally standardized advanced training program was developed jointly with the VDI and very successfully placed on the market. BuildingSMART Deutschland already lists 22 continuing education and training providers and offers corresponding BIM courses. Sarah Merz from the Certification Division at buildingSMART reports that the demand for this qualification offer is enormous: "The courses are fully booked. This year the Professional Certification Program of buildingSMART will start in Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Austria and Russia. Poland and Canada will follow next year. Thus, buildingSMART has also developed and established a worldwide standard in this important area of digitisation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Building owners rely on digitisation</strong><br />
<br />
Barbara-Maria Loth, Chief Digital Officer of the Knauf Group, Dirk Schaper, Managing Director of ProMaterial and Konrad Wernning, Managing Director of ARGE Neue Medien of the HVAC-industry discussed the significance of product data in the construction value chain on the closing day of the buildingSMART International Standards Summit. "Data is also abundant in the construction sector. However, the industry does not yet use them as comprehensively as they could. The end customer, on the other hand, is aware that he lives in a data-driven world and expects that architects, planners and contractors will also bring him real added value with the help of digitalisation," said Barbara-Maria Loth from Knauf. During the buildingSMART Summit, a separate roundtable was dedicated to the subject of product data. buildingSMART already has a solution for this important area in the form of the buildingSMART Data Dictionary, which is being developed further with high priority.<br />
<br />
<strong>GIS-BIM Integration, Common Data Environment, Digital Twin</strong><br />
<br />
Other top topics initiated at the buildingSMART International Standards Summit are the integration of GIS into BIM, i.e. the integration of data from geoinformation systems into digital planning, construction and operating models of buildings, as well as the development of fundamentals for common date environments and the digital twin. At the next buildingSMART International Standards Summit at the end of October in Beijing, concrete steps will be presented and initiated.<br />
