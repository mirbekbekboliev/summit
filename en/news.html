Dusseldorf is located directly at the river Rhine and has a wonderfull Old Town (Altstadt).&nbsp; The elegant, life-affirming city on the Rhine stands for fashion, shopping, culture and extraordinary events like the buildingSMART International Standards Summit. From Königsallee – fondly known as the “Kö”, one of Europe’s most luxurious shopping avenues – it’s just a short walk to the historical Altstadt (Old Town) with its 260 bars and restaurants. Its flair is world-famous, its narrow streets are vibrant, and the multifaceted cultural scene produces spectacular events and exhibitions.
